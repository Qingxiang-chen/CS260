normal tree (not in order) : node in the childern tree are not in order from left to right, node can be switch
binary tree (in order whatevry per post in-order): node in the childern tree are  in order from left to right, node can not be switch

   binary tree (in order) will be more efficient than normal tree(not in order) when you insert
       when you insert in normal tree(not in order), it will cost more time and more complixty beacuse it need visit every node when you got lot of node,
       for the binary tree (in order), it save time by split it in half and visit from root to down because it in order and dont need visit every node
